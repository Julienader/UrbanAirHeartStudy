This project explores the relationship between urban air conditions and its impact on human health, specifically focusing on heart diseases. With rising levels of air pollution in urban areas, understanding the correlation between air conditions and cardiovascular health is crucial for developing effective public health strategies.

Using a combination of data analysis techniques and visualization tools, this study analyzes air quality indicators and their potential link to the prevalence of heart disease cases. By uncovering patterns and insights, the project aims to contribute to evidence-based decision-making for policymakers and healthcare professionals.

Tools and Techniques
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas) 
Visualization: Tableau/Excel power
Data Sources: Open air quality datasets and  heart health statistics databases.
