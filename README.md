This project explores the relationship between urban air quality and its impact on human health, specifically focusing on heart diseases. With rising levels of air pollution in urban areas, understanding the correlation between pollutants and cardiovascular health is crucial for developing effective public health strategies.

Using a combination of data analysis techniques and visualization tools, this study analyzes air quality indicators such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and other pollutants, and their potential link to the prevalence of heart disease cases. By uncovering patterns and insights, the project aims to contribute to evidence-based decision-making for policymakers and healthcare professionals.
